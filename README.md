# HealthCareHackathon
From my participation in The School of AI's Health Hackathon. The repo was on a teammate's github and AWS account but there wasn't that much code to show anyway considering the tool's used.
For this hackathon I made a text-based chat bot for finding Dr's using Amazon Lex, Twilio, and an API with healthcare provider data.
I have provided a couple of screen shots of example conversations.
